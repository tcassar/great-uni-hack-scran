## Plan for the project

Meal / grocery planning app. Tell it what recipes you like, and what's in your fridge. 
Plugs into APIs of shops near you (coming soon) to look at realtime prices, helping you buy ingredients cost-effectively.
Hit different nutrition targets. Input daily caloric intake, and macronutrient goals. The app will plan meals with these in mind.

## What we wrote

Writing this in a day proved too difficult for a team of two.

However, we developed the engine to plan meals for the day. We did not manage to get ingredients from local shops. We managed to make good progress on the development of a front end.
